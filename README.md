<h1>Suggest me your commits</h1>
I wouldn't call myself a developer, because it's more a kind of hobby, so things I'm making are some kind of shit.
Nevertheless, this codec and it's tools are open for your commits and suggestions.
Edit the codec itself, suggest new tools or try to integrate it somewhere - everything will make this project better.

<b>Following things are very welcome, because I can hardly implement them on my own, so I'd appreciate your submissions:</b>
- foobar2000 decoder plugin
- Converter and player tools implemented in other programming languages
- SHLAC's technical imrovements

<b>Have fun!</b>
